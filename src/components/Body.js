     <p><strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hoppers</strong>(<a href="" target="_blank"></a>n√©e 
     <strong>Murray</strong>; December 9 , 1996 -January 1 ,1992) was an American 
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">computer scientist</a>and United States Navy rear admiral.[1]
     <mark>One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer</mark>, she was a pionner of computer programming, inventing one of the first compiler related tools.She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages,which led to the development of

     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank"></a>
     she had to join the Navy Reserves because she was too old    to   Hopper started her ccomputing career working in the Harvard M.H Aiken. In 1949,she joined the

     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I" target="_blank">UNIVAC</a> I in 1994. It was ar Eckert-Mauchly that she began developing the compiler.She believed that computer code could be written in English using a programming language based on English words.The compiler would convert that code into machine code understood by computers.By 1952,Hopper finished her compiler,which was written for the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-0_System">A-0 System</a>
     programming language.[2][3][4]
     <p> In 1954,Ecker-Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department,programming,and she led the release of some of the first com

     them in creating a machine-independent programming language.This led to the COBOL inspired by her idea of a language being based on English.In 1966,she retired from the Naval Reserve,but in 1967,the Navy recalled her into active duty.She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_corporation" target="_blank">Digital Equipment Cor</a>,sharing her computing experiences.</p>
